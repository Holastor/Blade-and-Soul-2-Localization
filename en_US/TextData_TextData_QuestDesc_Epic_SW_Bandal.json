He summoned the residents and announced that all activities in Suwol Port without his permission would be considered illegal. Seeing that everyone in the group expressed their displeasure at Lim's words, it seemed that the forced instructions were clear.\n\nThis is not the only thing. I was able to find Lim's suspicious activities throughout the quest. I saw Lim Yeon-soo running away from the annex by the lake without looking back, and behind the annex he ran away from, there was a monster and a fallen person that you couldn’t see in Vandal Lake. He said that after losing a lot of money in a martial arts contest, he can't even think of it anymore. The owner of the detached house was a local maintenance worker who supported Saho, and Shim Ha-yeon, who was usually dissatisfied with Saho, was indignant, saying that Yeonsu Lim would cross the line. After all, Lim Yeon-soo is too suspicious because he's just a bad-tempered shooter..."

The material I ordered from the smithy had not arrived yet, so it was a quest to urgently collect an alternative material, Lake Turtle Crystal. When I brought it to Fist, I could hear a new story. The cargo arrived earlier, but the cargo storage did not let it go. The cargo storage I went to to check the facts was full of undelivered baggage, and Lim Yeon-su's mercenaries I stood guarding the suspicious box like an iron barrel.\n\nIn the box were Lim Yeon-soo's letter telling me to wait three days for the items to be delivered to the Geumgyeongcheolmun to be shipped out, and the suspicious drink I drank before the finals of the martial arts competition. Judging by the fact that the captain also smelled of a terrible drink, he must have drank this nourishing tonic.\n \nWhen the iron fist heard of the incident, he became furious and took the letter and drink. I just hope that Saho will investigate and take action on the suspicious activities of Lim Yeon-soo discovered while carrying out the quest."
