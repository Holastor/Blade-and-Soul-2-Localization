Lee Samin asked me to consult Horyong, the owner of the Peach Blossom, on his behalf. Horyong listened to me and corroborated the statement about having to get a permit. He suggested that we discuss a possible solution, but first he needed a sample of the baskets to see if they were really so high in quality.\n\nI brought the materials to Shin Haywol, who made a sample right on the spot. I delivered the sample to Horyong and relayed Samin's story. Horyong said he'd talk to the manager and find a way to help the settlers adapt to their new lives more easily.

So, instead of talking to them, I decided to just listen first. Then, I saw the Sol Seekers manager talking to a subordinate. It turned out that he had witnessed a lot of people being killed and injured during the earlier settlement period. He gave unsolicited advice to others because he wanted to avoid a repeat of those events. When his advice annoyed and even offended some people, he got frustrated and shouted at them. He meant well, but he just didn't know how to express himself properly.\n\nI went back to the Plum Blossoms and explained this to them. Gun Jagam said he understood and would talk things out with the Sol Seekers. I'm glad that's been cleared up."

Horyong then requested help with holding a banquet to improve the relationship between the two groups. I was glad to lend a hand.\n\nI went to invite the Plum Blossom, Soul Steel, and the Sol Seekers. I thought they'd all be happy to be there, but it seems I was hoping for too much. Moonwind was especially unhappy, making a claim that she was only invited as an afterthought. Mehwa and the Sol Seeker manager accepted their invitations without any issues.\n\nAfter I invited them, I moved to the shore to pick up some special cooking ingredients for the banquet. If food made with these ingredients can help lift the tension among the groups and improve their relationship, I'll be glad.\n\nLater, I went to see Horyong, but he said he was too busy to be out in the field. He asked me to let him know if I find anything interesting while exploring Haewol. Now I feel obligated to pay more attention while I explore, but... I'll just do as he asks."

Despite Horyong's efforts to smooth things out with a banquet, they were still not getting along. I decided to hear out Gun Jagam, a Plum Blossom who refused to get help from the Sol Seekers.\n\nWhen I met Gun Jagam in the field, he was excited that he discovered Blue Bandits on the way to the Shipwreck Gravesite. He thought we should look into them and deliver the information to the Sol Seekers. The Sol Seekers would appreciate knowing about the situation, and it's help them to maintain peace in the area.\n\nIt also seemed Gun Jagam had a personal stake in this. He was hoping that by delivering the information to the Sol Seekers, he'd improve his group's reputation with them. Are the Plum Blossoms still not comfortable working with the Sol Seekers? It seems Gun Jagam thinks the Sol Seekers look down on his group. I don't know if that's true or not, so I can't refute that. For now, I'm just going to help him gather evidence against the Blue Bandits."

Gun Jagam must have liked the way their investigation went this time, because he said he'd love to work with me again. I enjoyed the work and helping the Plum Blossoms, but... I don't think I'll take him up on that.\n\nEventually, it was time for us to go back to the base. I thought Jagam would go talk to the Sol Seekers about the Blue Bandits on his own, but h said he didn't feel comfortable doing it himself, so he asked me instead. I thought it'd be better if he went to present their achievement to the Sol Seekers on his own, but I kept quiet.\n\nIt wasn't hard to deliver the evidence and message on his behalf. I have a feeling that these two groups will need more time to make up with each other."

He said the water here used to be clean and tasted refreshing. He asked me to search for the cause of the tainted water.\n\nSince we had nothing to go on, I decided to go through as many possibilities as I could. First, some strange-looking flowers and dead animals near the water... Maybe one of those could be the cause. There was some strange-looking filth floating near the water as well, which I also collected.\n\nPong Pong didn't seem concerned by the flowers or carcasses, but was very interested in the strange filth. He began to suspect that someone might have intentionally scattered it. I got curious and asked whether all Barons convene with Furlong when something like this happens. Pong Pong said the Barons share and talk about everything, whether it be important or trivial. I guess they really are quite different from people."

As cruel as it may sound, he was probably right. However, I went just in case.\n\nSurprisingly, I heard someone calling for help. Could it be her? I looked around and found Da Doyon. It was a relief that she was still alive. I took her to a safe place, and she told me that problems had been arising in the area because the settlers had been removing the mud. She wondered if the Saho would be interested in handling such a problem. I'm inclined to think so, so I'd better talk to Horyong about it when I have the chance."
