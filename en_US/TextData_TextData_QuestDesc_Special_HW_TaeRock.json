He said he wanted to open a banquet and improve people's relationships and asked for help in preparation.\n\nI went to ask to attend the plum flower garden, Geumgyeongcheolmun, and weeping. In particular, I was embarrassed because he got angry saying that the moonlight wind was making him a folding screen. Still, it was fortunate that the Hong Maehwa manager and the foster care manager accepted the message without saying much.\n\nAfter the delivery was over, it was I went to the beach to get special cooking ingredients. This will make people feel better and if a good relationship is formed, my small effort will pay off in a big way.\n\nAfter work, Ho-ryong Kwak, who I met after work, He said that he didn't have enough time to look around the site and asked him to let us know if he found out anything while exploring the continent."

Even though Kwak Ho-ryong tried to create a good atmosphere by holding a banquet, there seemed to be a distance between them. If you don't want to receive it, let's hear the story by helping the plum blossom team member Geonjagam.\n\nJagam Geon, whom we met at the site, was delighted to find a group of spearmen on the way to the wreck's tomb. He said that it would be good to figure it out and pass it on to Suyang. Actually, such information would be very good information for Suyang as it will be a great help in maintaining security in the surrounding area.\n\nBut after hearing more about it... it has a slightly different meaning If you pass this information on to Suyang, you think the way the foster members look at them will change? Is it still a bit far from Suyang? Since we don't know, we can't deny that it isn't. Yeah... First of all, let's collect the evidence of the spear gang as we wish."

I came back from the expedition and it seems like it was a success. Jagam Geon said that he liked this expedition very much and that he would like to continue with him in the future. \n\nNow is the time to return to the base. I thought I would report directly to Suyang regarding the spear gang, but he said it was difficult to speak and asked if he could speak on his behalf. It would be better to go and show Suyang in person I thought it would, but I didn't say anything. It wasn't difficult to convey the words along with the evidence. But I thought that it would take a little more time for the relationship between the two to improve."

The water here is clean and tastes good, so I want to quickly find out the cause of the bad water. I asked him to find things that might be related.\n\nIt was difficult to determine what might be related, so I decided to find as many as possible. First of all, flowers and dead animals that I couldn't find anywhere else. The strange filth floating around the water, too. Once you take it all, you'll judge it well!\n\nPong-Pong, who didn't show much interest in flowers or corpses, is very interested in filth and suspects that someone may have intentionally sprayed it. Suddenly curious, the Barongs asked if they consulted with Perong Perong every time something like this happened. Pong Pong said, Barongs share and talk about anything, regardless of trivial or important. Barong is also with humans. Is it something a little different?"

They seemed worried.\n\nI followed Lee Yul-gyeong to the slope of the sunrise and confirmed the presence of a threat. The Myomyeon tribe and the Nakwon tribe stayed on the slope, so it seemed that they could be attacked at any time. As Kyung said, ordinary tourists would be very dangerous.
