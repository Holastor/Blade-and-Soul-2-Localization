I heard a voice asking for help.\n\nI moved in haste following the voice, and there was Wawa, a Suwa tribe, who was desperately waiting for a helping hand in the remnants of the collapsed building.\nI couldn't get out because the fence was blocking the door. Dun Wawa was very grateful and said that they would repay them if they came to their temporary base."

The Suwa people are currently in a dilemma, so they decide to do something first to reclaim the village from the eroded monsters. I did.\n\nDefeated the eroded monsters that occupied the village, searched for the leftover Suwa tribes and returned them to a temporary base. Daewa was very grateful for the unexpected achievement.\n\nNow the last one There is only one problem left: hunting the monster of the valley, Kang Cheol-eak. According to Daewa, the Suwa warriors who fought against Cheol-eak are also a threat to the point of losing several lives. Let's go on a hunt for steel music."

In the end, he had to deal with Cheol-eak alone, but he managed to defeat it. I was able to.\n\nI heard unexpected news from Daewa, the village chief of the Suwa tribe, who seems to be in bad shape. It was a pet dog tag that Kang Cheol-ak was wearing. It seemed to have spurred the fear of the residents by smuggling it in, bringing it in, and then releasing it here.\n\nEven the Suwa village chief and even the chieftain of the Suwa tribe were furious about his evil deeds, while learning that there was no need to fear because of the tyranny of Cheol-eak. He seemed happy. After the conversation with Wawa, who came to him because he was worried about it too late, he left the Eerie Valley. I hope that the Suwa village reconstruction plan goes smoothly."

Instead of reflecting, he summoned a mercenary and saw an opportunity to escape. \n\n However, it's a no-brainer! When the mercenaries were easily subdued, Saho appeared just in time. Saho immediately dismissed Lim Yeon-soo from the post of gunman and ended the case by making him pay a fair price. While I was proud of the thought, the red plum came to me, thanked me, and suggested that I work for Vandal Lake with them, but I have a job to do. It was disappointing, but they cheered for the future."
