        "text": "The mystical stone that slashes the sky and closes the deadly Fissures is called Caelite.\n\nWhen Aran told me he planned to participate in the Championship to win that mysterious crystal, my heart started to pound. It's the perfect chance for me to leave the mountains and venture out into the world! Without a second's hesitation, I followed Aran to the Sapphire Basin, where the Championship would be held.\n\nTo our surprise, we were first greeted by Hollows emerging from a fissure! As if the Hollows weren't enough, Ecizer appeared as well! Ecizer is a being which once had its energy absorbed and reinjected by the Sura, which makes it much more powerful than the Hollows. I could have been seriously hurt if it wasn't for Aran's help.\n\nBut wait, there's more... This Bulbari I saved from the Hollows turned into a Soul and entered my body. I felt a pleasing warmth and could sense my strength increasing.\n\nFinally, I made it to the arena. I'm a little anxious about the preliminaries, so I should warm up and get used to my weapon!"
